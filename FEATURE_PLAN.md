# Feature Plan: Authentication System Implementation

## Overview
**Issue**: #5 - Authentication System Implementation  
**Priority**: High  
**Epic**: Backend Core Development  
**Dependencies**: Issues #1, #2, #4 (completed)

## Objective
Implement JWT-based authentication system with refresh tokens following DevSecOps best practices.

## Technical Approach

### 1. Backend Implementation (FastAPI)
- **User Model & Database Schema**
  - User table with email, hashed_password, is_active, is_verified fields
  - Alembic migrations for database schema
  - SQLAlchemy models with proper relationships

- **Password Security**
  - bcrypt hashing with proper salt rounds (12+)
  - Password strength validation
  - Secure password reset flow

- **JWT Implementation**
  - Access tokens (15min expiry) 
  - Refresh tokens (7 days expiry, stored securely)
  - Proper token signing with RS256 or HS256
  - Token blacklisting capability

- **API Endpoints**
  ```
  POST /api/v1/auth/register
  POST /api/v1/auth/login  
  POST /api/v1/auth/refresh
  POST /api/v1/auth/logout
  POST /api/v1/auth/verify-email
  POST /api/v1/auth/forgot-password
  POST /api/v1/auth/reset-password
  GET  /api/v1/auth/me
  ```

- **Security Features**
  - Rate limiting on auth endpoints (5 attempts per minute)
  - CORS configuration
  - Input validation with Pydantic
  - API key generation for users
  - Session management

### 2. Database Integration
- **Alembic Migrations**
  - Initial user table migration
  - Indexes for performance (email, created_at)
  - Foreign key constraints

- **Connection Management**
  - Async SQLAlchemy connection pooling
  - Proper transaction handling
  - Database health checks

### 3. Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**
  - Password hashing/verification
  - JWT token creation/validation
  - User registration/login flows
  - Rate limiting functionality

- **Integration Tests**
  - Database operations
  - API endpoint testing
  - Authentication middleware
  - Error handling scenarios

### 4. DevSecOps Implementation
- **Security Scanning**
  - Bandit security analysis
  - Dependency vulnerability checks
  - OWASP compliance validation

- **Code Quality**
  - Type hints with mypy
  - Linting with ruff
  - Format with black
  - Pre-commit hook validation

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Authentication (Branch: feature/auth-core)
1. **Database Models & Migrations**
   - Create User model with SQLAlchemy
   - Set up Alembic migrations
   - Add database connection management

2. **Password Management**
   - Implement bcrypt hashing utilities
   - Add password validation rules
   - Create secure password reset tokens

3. **JWT Service**
   - Token generation/validation utilities
   - Refresh token management
   - Token blacklisting system

### Phase 2: API Implementation (Branch: feature/auth-api)
1. **Authentication Endpoints**
   - Register endpoint with email verification
   - Login/logout with proper token handling
   - Refresh token endpoint
   - Password reset flow

2. **Middleware & Dependencies**
   - Authentication dependency injection
   - Rate limiting middleware
   - Error handling improvements

3. **Security Hardening**
   - CORS configuration update
   - Request validation
   - Audit logging

### Phase 3: Testing & Documentation (Branch: feature/auth-testing)
1. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Unit test coverage >90%
   - Integration tests for all endpoints
   - Security testing scenarios
   - Load testing for auth endpoints

2. **Documentation**
   - API documentation updates
   - Security guidelines
   - Deployment considerations

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] User registration with email verification
- [ ] Login/logout endpoints working
- [ ] JWT access tokens (15min expiry)
- [ ] Refresh tokens (7 days expiry) 
- [ ] Password hashing with bcrypt
- [ ] Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- [ ] API key generation for users

### Security Requirements  
- [ ] Tokens properly signed and validated
- [ ] Password complexity requirements enforced
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- [ ] Secure token storage and transmission
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] OWASP security best practices followed

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] All auth endpoints tested
- [ ] Unit test coverage >90%
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Security scan passes (Bandit)
- [ ] Load testing completed

### DevOps Requirements
- [ ] Docker environment updated
- [ ] Database migrations automated
- [ ] ArgoCD deployment working
- [ ] Health checks include auth status
- [ ] Monitoring and logging configured

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **JWT Security**: Improper token handling could lead to security vulnerabilities
- **Database Security**: Exposed credentials or weak password hashing

### Medium Risk  
- **Rate Limiting**: Insufficient protection against brute force attacks
- **Token Expiry**: Balance between security and user experience

### Low Risk
- **Performance**: Authentication overhead on API requests
- **Compatibility**: Integration with existing frontend theme

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests passing (unit, integration, security)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed via ArgoCD successfully
- [ ] Security audit passed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## Estimated Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 2-3 days (Core auth infrastructure)
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 days (API implementation) 
- **Phase 3**: 1-2 days (Testing & docs)
- **Total**: 5-8 days

## Success Metrics
- Authentication endpoints respond in <100ms
- Zero security vulnerabilities in scan
- 100% uptime during auth operations
- User registration/login success rate >99%
